Programming Assignment 0.5

In this assignment, you will use a Java ReentrantLock and Java
ConditionObject to implement a subset of the Java
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class, which we call SimpleSemaphore.
This assignment also reuses the SimpleAtomicLock you implemented for
Assignment 0, so make sure it's working properly before attempting
this assignment!  The goal of this assignment is to use the
SimpleSemaphore to correctly implement a resource manager that limits
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a Palantir (if you're not a Lord of the Ring's fan see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir for more information on
Palantir).

The PalantirManagerTest.java program creates three Palantiri and five
Threads (one for each Palantir user) that concurrently attempt to
acquire a Palantir and gaze into it for a certain amount of time.  If
the SimpleSemaphore and SimpleAtomicLock are implemented properly the
test should succeed without throwing any exceptions.

In this directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  However, the only two files you need to modify are
SimpleAtomicLong.java class and SimpleSemaphore, which contains the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You
fill in here" portions!!!

In particular, you'll need to do the following:

. Implement the SimpleAtomicLong class, which you should replace with
  your working solution to assignment0.

. Implement the SimpleSemaphore class using a Java ConditionObject and
  Java ReentrantLock, which are covered in these videos:
  
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 5: Java ReentrantLock
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 8: Java ConditionObject 

  There are also relevant discussions about using Java
  ConditionObjects at these links that may help with the
  SimpleSemaphore implementation:

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11308768/condition-should-unlock-before-await

. Your SimpleSemaphore implementation must support the "Fair" and
  "NotFair" semantics, which are covered in this video:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 7: Java Semaphore

  It's easy to support both these semantics if you watch the Java
  ReentrantLock video and understand how its constructor works.

. The PalantirManagerTest.java program also uses various features of
  Java Threads and Runnables, which are described in these videos:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 1: Overview of Java Threads (Part 1)
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 2: Overview of Java Threads (Part 2)

At the moment, all these videos are available in the YouTube playlist

When the 2014 POSA MOOC officially starts these videos will be
available at

https://class.coursera.org/posa-002/lecture

We'll also discuss this assignment specification (and later its
solution) in the POSA MOOC "Virtual Office Hours", which are described
in item #38 at the POSA MOOC FAQ available from

http://www.courera.org/course/posa

To compile this code you can either use the provided Eclipse project
or go into the src directory and simply type

% javac FairnessChecker.java Palantir.java PalantirManager.java
  PalantirManagerTest.java SimpleAtomicLong.java SimpleSemaphore.java

on the command-line and then run the resulting class file by typing

% java PalantirManagerTest

The output for a correct solution should look something this (your
output order might be slightly different depending on your JVM/OS
scheduler and hardware platform):
